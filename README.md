### Tips:
  
- Use 7 to save a position and 8 to come back later to that position.
- Use .asc file by directly opening them and not dropping them to the screen.
- Change scale -> 0.1 and offset-> -99999 to see how the .tif file data is shown or there'd be a single spike only.
- Use ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72426535/148815212-9c4a5423-d38c-4f8e-aa00-d9882fd90583.png) when you want to add other .asc data to already single file, it'll merge them all.
- Use config(folder)> config.txt> ui_scale(line): no. -> 1.5 from 1, to change the size of layout in the application.
- Rayleigh uses the other opposite to it in the colour wheel:
